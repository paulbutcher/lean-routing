# `Routing`: a typed HTTP path router

Compojure's low-ceremony shape (`route .get "/users/:id:Nat" handler`),
with Servant's static guarantee that a wrong-arity/wrong-type handler is a
compile error -- without writing a macro. See
`docs/routing-design-plan.md` for the full design rationale (three
reference designs considered, the throwaway spike that confirmed the core
mechanism, and two pitfalls found and root-caused on this toolchain); this
is a short orientation for someone reading the code.

## Design overview

A route pattern string (`"/users/:id:Nat"`) parses (`Routing/Pattern.lean`)
into `List PathSeg`, plain runtime data -- no type-level encoding. From
that *value*, `HandlerType segs result` (`Routing/Handler.lean`) computes
the *type* a matching handler must have (one argument per capture,
correctly typed via `CaptureKind.type`), using Lean's dependent types
directly -- unlike Haskell/Servant, no DataKinds or type families are
needed to compute a type from a value. A handler with the wrong arity or
capture types is therefore rejected at the point a `Route` is built,
exactly like Servant's `HasServer`-checked API type, but with routes
staying ordinary data (Compojure's ergonomics) rather than a type-level
API description.

What Lean does *not* derive automatically is matching an incoming
request's path against a pattern and applying the handler to the
extracted values -- `dispatch` (`Routing/Handler.lean`) is a hand-written
dependent fold doing that job; Servant gets the equivalent for free from
typeclass instance resolution, Lean does not have that mechanism here.
This is a real, accepted cost of the "no macro" v1 decision (§2 of the
design doc), not a gap expected to close later.

`Route`/`dispatchTable` (`Routing/Route.lean`) bundle a method, pattern,
and handler into a route table, tried in order. `toHandler`
(`Routing/Server.lean`) wires that table into
`Std.Http.Server.Handler.ofFn`'s expected
`Request Body.Stream → ContextAsync (Response Body.Any)` shape, decoding
the request's path via `RequestTarget.path.toDecodedSegments` and falling
back to `404` when nothing matches.

## The one hand-rolled piece of logic, and why

Pattern strings are parsed by a structural recursion over `List Char`
(`Routing/Pattern.lean`), deliberately **not** `String.splitOn`: on this
toolchain (`v4.31.0`, `String` rebuilt around `String.Slice`), a
`String.splitOn`-based parser does not reduce through kernel defeq, which
silently breaks `HandlerType`-computed types built from its output (the
design doc's §3 records the isolated repro). Dispatch and capture typing
are guaranteed by `HandlerType`/the equation compiler with no proof
needed; the hand-rolled parser is the exception, and has a real
`theorem` (`parsePattern_renderPattern`, `RoutingTests/Pattern.lean`) proving it
round-trips on well-formed input, plus `#guard` regressions for malformed
input (doubled/trailing `/`, unknown or missing capture kind, empty
capture name) all failing via `none`, never a panic. Tests live in the
separate `RoutingTests` library (`lakefile.toml`'s `testDriver`).

## Not yet supported (deferred, see `docs/routing-design-plan.md` §5)

- **Query-string parameters** -- `dispatch` only matches the path.
- **Reverse routing** (generating a URL from a route value, Yesod's
  killer feature) -- routes staying plain `List PathSeg` data rather than
  a type-level encoding should make this additive later, but that's not
  verified yet.
- **`CaptureKind` is a closed enum** (`Nat`/`String` only). Whether to open
  it into a typeclass so downstream code can add capture types is
  deferred.

## How to add a route

Call `route method pattern handler` (`Routing/Route.lean`) with a pattern
string and a handler whose argument types match each `:name:Kind` capture
in order (`Nat` for `:Nat`, `String` for `:String`), then add it to the
`List (Route Result)` passed to `toHandler` (`Routing/Server.lean`).
