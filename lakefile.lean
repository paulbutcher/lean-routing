/-- The tests live in their own package (`test/`) so that nothing they need reaches a
downstream consumer's dependency graph, which means they can only be run as a child process.
`scripts/` holds the two checks that keep the Lean package out of a consumer's binary
(`README.md`); they run here, rather than by hand, so that a plain `import Lean` cannot get
back in unnoticed. -/
