# Nothing from the Lean package may reach a consumer's binary, `route_table` and `mount_routes`
# included. `check-imports.sh` reads that claim off the library's source; this one reads it off
# an executable that actually uses both macros, which is the form the claim is about.
#
# `test/LeanFree.lean` is that executable. Building it builds the library too, so everything
# examined below is this checkout's own output rather than whatever was lying around.
#
# Note that the link line is not the place to look: Lake names `-lLean` for every executable it
# builds, whether or not anything needs it, and a library archive contributes only the members
# something referred to. What ended up in the binary is the answer.
