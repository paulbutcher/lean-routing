Decoding an `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` request body (`title=Buy+milk`) into
`(name, value)` pairs.

Hand-rolled structural recursion over `List Char`, deliberately not `String.splitOn` -- the same
choice `Routing/Pattern.lean` made for pattern strings, for the same reason: this toolchain's
`String.splitOn` doesn't play well with the kind of char-by-char processing percent-decoding also
needs (turning `%XX` into a single decoded character as it goes), so one uniform `List Char`
recursion handles splitting *and* decoding rather than mixing `String.splitOn` with a separate
decode pass.

This module only exists because `Routing/Server.lean` now threads the full `Request Body.Stream`
into every handler (`Result := Request Body.Stream → ContextAsync (Response Body.Any)`) -- once a
handler can call `request.body.readAll (α := String)` to get the raw body, something has to turn
that into `(name, value)` pairs, and `Std.Http.URI`'s query-string types aren't a fit (see
`docs/todo-app-plan.md`: `URI.EncodedQueryString`'s constructor is `private` with a validity proof
obligation, built for parsing URIs, not for reinterpreting an arbitrary body string).

/-- Percent-decodes a `List Char`, accumulating the (reversed) decoded output in `acc`: `+`
becomes a space, `%XX` becomes the single character with that codepoint, and a `%` not followed by
two valid hex digits (including one at the very end of the input) is passed through literally
rather than failing the whole decode -- form bodies in the wild are usually decoded tolerantly,
and this is a demo app's input path, not a place to panic on a stray `%`. -/
